Given an unsigned integer, reverse all bits of it and return the number with reversed bits.The idea is to keep putting set bits of the num in reverse_num until num becomes zero. After num becomes zero, shift the remaining bits of reverse_num.
Let num is stored using 8 bits and num be 00000110. After the loop you will get reverse_num as 00000011. Now you need to left shift reverse_num 5 more times and you get the exact reverse 01100000.

Input : n = 1
Output : 2147483648  
On a machine with size of unsigned
bit as 32. Reverse of 0....001 is
100....0.
Input : n = 2147483648
Output : 1
